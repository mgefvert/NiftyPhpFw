Nifty PHP Framework

There is an introduction in the /doc/get-started folder that tells you how to get started.
It's incomplete and somewhat outdated though. Working on it.

There is also a commented example in the /examples folder, which highlights different 
aspects of the Nifty PHP Framework. You are welcome to check it out, try it (using Apache) 
and see how it works.

The "source" folder contains a minimal file structure that you can use for your own projects. 
Just copy the file structure (app, public, sys and tools folders) to your web host, and you should 
basically be done. Make sure that the document root of the web server points to the "public" 
folder, and not the base folder with the app and sys folders. (You can rename "public" to "html" 
or whatever you want, it works fine.)
  
Hope you like it :)

Remember, although the documentation, unit tests and the git repository is a work in progress, 
the framework in itself is pretty stable and is used in several large production systems.

Since changing the paths around for the git repo, there are one or two tests that fail too. It
will be fixed shortly.
